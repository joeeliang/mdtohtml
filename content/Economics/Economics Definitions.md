[[Economics HL]]
Abnormal profit

This arises when average revenue is greater than average cost (greater than the minimum return required by a firm to remain in a line of business).

Absolute advantage

A country has an absolute advantage in the production of a good if it can produce more of it with the same resources or, equivalently, if it can produce the same amount using fewer resources compared to another country.

Absolute poverty

People living below the minimum income necessary to satisfy basic physical needs (food, clothing, and shelter); as of October 2015, the World Bank international poverty line is set at US$1.90 PPP per day.

Abuse of market power

When a firm acts with the intention to eliminate competitors or to prevent entry of new firms in a market.

Actual growth

Occurs when real output (real GDP) increases through time and is a result of greater or better use of existing resources. In the PPC model it can be illustrated by a movement from a point inside a PPC to another point in the northeast direction.

Administrative barriers

Trade barriers in the form of regulations that aim to limit imports into a country. These barriers may take the form of product safety standards, sanitary standards or pollution standards but may also include more stringent than necessary application of customs procedures.

Adverse selection

A type of market failure involving asymmetric information, where the party with the incomplete information is induced to withdraw from the market. The buyer, for example, of a used car, may hesitate to buy without knowing about the quality of the vehicle. The seller, for example of health insurance, may hesitate to sell a policy without knowing the health of the buyer.

Aggregate demand (AD)

Planned spending on domestic goods and services at different average price levels, per period of time. Consists of consumption, investment and government expenditures plus net exports.

Aggregate supply curve

A curve showing the planned level of output that domestic firms are willing and able to offer at different average price levels.

Allocative efficiency

Achieved when just the right amount of goods and services are produced from society's point of view so that scarce resources are allocated in the best possible way. It is achieved when, for the last unit produced, price (P) is equal to marginal cost (MC), or more generally, if marginal social benefit (MSB) is equal to marginal social cost (MSC).

Allocative inefficiency

When either more or less than the socially optimal amount is produced and consumed so that misallocation of resources results. MSB ≠ MSC.

Alternative business objectives to profit maximization

Corporate social responsibility: Many firms now realise that they need to take action to reduce future social and environmental risks to their own businesses, as well as to do the right thing now.  
  
Market share: If a firm aims to grow very quickly, it may be able to gain a significant market share, achieving economies of scale and reducing production costs. This leads to profit maximization in the long run.  
  
Satisficing: the firm aims to achieve a level of profit that will satisfy shareholders, but not achieve a maximum, since profit maximising may risk their other internal and external goals, e.g. work life balance for employees

Anchoring

Refers to situations when people rely on a piece of information that is not necessarily relevant as a reference point when making a decision.

Assumptions about consumer behavior

Rational consumers have clear preferences for goods and services that are stable and transitive.  
Rational consumers have highly developed analytical skills that enable them to compare choices and determine the goods they prefer  
Rational consumers have perfect information  
Rational consumers seek to maximize utility at all times.

Assumptions underlying the law of demand

Income effect: as price decreases, the real income of consumers rises, as each unit of income can now buy more goods; hence quantity demanded increases.  
  
Substitution effect: as price decreases, consumers purchasing more expensive substitutes will switch to purchasing the good, such that quantity demanded increases.  
  
Law of diminishing marginal utility: for each unit of good consumed, the additional utility gained by the consumer decreases. Hence price must decrease for consumers to demand a larger quantity of the good.

Assumptions underlying the law of supply

Law of diminishing marginal returns: If marginal returns (output/product) decline, then more and more inputs will be needed to increase output. This will increase the marginal costs of production.  
  
As marginal costs of production increase as output increases, producers are only willing and able to accept higher prices to cover their higher costs.

Asymmetric information

A type of market failure where one party in an economic transaction has access to more or better information than the other party.

A grade assigned by certain agencies (such as Moody's or Standard and Poor's) on the borrowing risks a prospective issuer of debt (for example, of a bond) presents to lenders.

Crowding out

The idea that expansionary fiscal policy is not very effective in increasing aggregate demand because the increased borrowing needs of the government to finance the increased expenditures could lead to increased interest rates. Thus, reducing private sector investment, consumer spending, and other components of AD.

Some FDI exploit a country's scarce resources and are mainly beneficial to the MNC.  
Loss of culture and tradition due to globalization

Incentive-related policies

Policies that aim at improving economic incentives of individuals and firms.

Incentive role of prices

Prices provide producers and consumers the incentive to respond to price changes. Given a price change, producers have the incentive to change the quantity supplied in accordance with the law of supply, while consumers have the incentive to change the quantity demanded based on the law of demand.

Income

A flow of earnings from using factors of production to produce goods and services. Wages and salaries are the factor reward to labour and interest is the flow of income for the ownership of capital.

Income approach

One of the three equivalent ways that GDP can be measured, by adding all the incomes generated in the production process (wages, profits, interest and rent) for a given time period.

Income effect

The law of demand is explained by the substitution and the income effect. The income effect states that if the price of a good increases then the real income of consumers decreases and, typically, they will tend to buy less of the good—thus working in the same direction as the substitution effect.

Investment (I)

Spending by firms on capital goods such as machines, tools, equipment and factories.

J-curve

Following devaluation or a sharp depreciation, a trade deficit will typically widen before it starts improving thus tracing the letter "J" if plotted against time, because the Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied only after a period of several months following the decreased value of the currency.

Joint supply

Goods jointly produced, for example beef and cattle hides; producing one automatically leads to the production of the other.

Keynesian aggregate supply curve

An aggregate supply curve that shows the level of real output produced in an economy in relation to the price level. It consists of three sections: a horizontal section, an upward-sloping section and a vertical section. Changes in real GDP or the price level depend on aggregate demand and how close to capacity the economy is operating.
