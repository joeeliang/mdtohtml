There are two mechanisms that stabilize the economy automatic without action by government authorities.
# Progressive income taxes
Mentioned in [[Reduce poverty and Inequality]]. The two scenarios:
- During inflationary periods, income rises. The income that is taxed rises proportionally more, slowing down the increase in [[Aggregate Demand]].
- Similarly, in recessionary periods, the income that is taxed decreases, reducing the decrease in aggregate demand.
# Unemployment benefits
- In a recession, the unemployment increases, while unemployment benefits increase. The increase allows the unemployed to maintain the level of consumption to some extent, slowing the blow of decreasing [[Aggregate Demand]].
- During inflationary periods, the unemployment benefits decrease, leading to a smaller increase in aggregate demand.
