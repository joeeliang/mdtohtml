Increase in real GDP.
Growth is calculated with percent change formula.

There is **short term** and **long term** growth. They are essentially the changes of the short or long run curves. The long run is associated with the upward sloping curve in the [[Business Cycle]], while the short run is associated with the expansionary phases.

If we use the [[Production Possibilities Curve]] as our measurement, short term is associated with points getting closer to the PPC, and long term is an expansion of the possibilities.

## Causes
### Short term
- Increase in AD
- Increase in SRAS
- Reduction in unemployment

### Long term
- improvement in efficiency
- increased quantity
- technological change

Look at factors that influence the [[Aggregate Supply]].
Improvements in physical capital is much more sustainable as a method of growth compared to relying on natural capital.
## Benefits of economic growth
These are pretty standard, just think of what people can do with money.
- Higher living standards
- Women
- Government spending on public or merit goods
- better for the environment

Achieving the goal of sustainable economic growth and low [[Inflation]], LRAS must move while AD moves. Cost-pull inflations cannot lead to growth.
