Here's an example:

**Minimum Reserve Requirement and Monetary Multiplier**

Suppose the central bank sets a minimum reserve requirement of 20% for commercial banks. This means that for every $100 deposited into a commercial bank, the bank must hold at least $20 in reserve and cannot lend out more than $80.

Let's say a customer deposits $100 into Bank A. Bank A must hold $20 in reserve and can lend out $80 to another customer. This $80 is then deposited into Bank B, which must also hold 20% ($16) in reserve and can lend out $64 to another customer. This process continues, with each bank holding 20% in reserve and lending out the remaining amount.

**Money Creation**

* Initial deposit: $100
* Bank A lends: $80
* Bank B lends: $64
* Bank C lends: $51.20
* ...and so on

The total amount of money created is the initial deposit multiplied by the monetary multiplier, which is the reciprocal of the reserve requirement:

Monetary Multiplier = 1 / 0.20 = 5

Total Money Created = $100 x 5 = $500

In this example, the initial deposit of $100 has led to the creation of $500 in new money in the economy.

Note: This is a simplified example and in reality, the process is more complex, but it illustrates the concept of minimum reserve requirement and monetary multiplier.
