# Analysis
Brazil is the eleventh largest economy in the world, and American is its second largest trading partner. Due to the comparative advantage of Brazil in:
- **Climate**: Brazil's mild winters and hot, humid summers create an ideal climate for coffee production, allowing for two harvests per year. 
- **Soil**: Brazil's coffee-growing regions have rich, fertile, and acidic soil that prevents diseases and pests, making it well-suited for coffee production. 
- **Labor**: Brazil has a large and relatively low-cost workforce, making it easier for coffee farmers to hire workers for harvesting, processing, and other tasks.
United States is leading producer of aeroplanes. The factors include
- **Skilled Work Force**: America has a large sector for technicians and engineers.
- **Technology:** The United States has many companies heavily invested in research and development.
So, since the two countries have comparative advantage over each other for Coffee and Airplanes, they trade.
