**Definition:** Sustained increase in general price level.
Inflation that is decreases is disinflation.
## Measurement
Consumer price index: a basket of goods that are considered typical. Monitor the price of this basket over subsequent years to derive the rate of inflation.
### Problems
- Different consumers have different tastes.
- Varies across regions
- Does not account for quality changes
- Difficult to compare over long periods of time

# Causes
Split into the two categories that can easily be drawn on AD/AS diagram:
Demand-pull inflation and cost-push inflation. Cost is supply.

# Costs
Here's a relationship, units in ($\Delta \%$):
$$real\ income = nominal\ income - inflation$$
Losers: **Unfairly redistributes income.**
- People who receive fixed income wages, or increase less rapidly than the rate of inflation
- Holders of cash
- Savers
- Lenders
Winners: Basically the opposites
- Borrowers
- Payers of fixed things.

But overall, it creates uncertainty, which leads to low investment and therefor lower economic growth. 

There can also be [[Hyperinflation]].
Ultimately though, there needs to be stable rate of inflation to prevent economy from going into [[Deflation]]. Usually this is around the 2-3% level.
