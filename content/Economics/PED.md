[[Elasticities]]

## Factors
Number of closeness and substitutes. The categorization of *goods* can change this measure. A broad categorization has less substitution and will be less elastic.

Necessity or luxury

Length of time to make decision
Longer length of time makes consumer more sensitive to differences in prices, leading to a more elastic demand.

Proportion of income spent on a good
Larger portion is more elastic since consumers will be more considerate.

## HL
Primary and manufactured commodities

Primary commodities have more inelastic demands since they are essential and have no substitutes. A consequence for farmers is an increase in price results in larger revenues. One way to increase prices are by reducing supply. So there is an ironic conclusion where a more inefficient farm producing less will generate greater revenue. How interesting.
