$P_{w}$ is the equilibrium price level set by the supply and demand of the international market.
# Exports

The excess quantity supplied, $Q_{s}-Q_{d}$,, will be exported. There is welfare gain since the producers get to sell more at a higher price. However, the consumers lose since they are getting less at a higher price. Nonetheless, the overall effect is a welfare gain.
# Imports

When the country opens to international trade, there is a price at $P_{w}$. At that price, the country can only produce at $Q_{s}$, while the people demand $Q_{d}$. So the government imports $Q_{d}- Q_{s}$ .
