[[Equity and Equality]]
Economic inequality refers to a few things
- Unequal distribution of income
- Unequal distribution of wealth
## Measurement
See the distribution of income quintiles, or boxes of percentages.
hello diagram, Lorenz curve.

**Gini Coefficient:** Area between the diagonal and the curve (A), area under the diagonal (B), formula is $\frac{A}{A + B}$

The unequal distribution of wealth is often twice as bad as income. Reasons for this include:
- Limited growth in wages make it difficult to save and buy
- High income people spend smaller portions of income therefor get to purchase more assets, exacerbating the gap.
