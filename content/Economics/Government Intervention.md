[[Economics HL]]
## Objectives
- Earn revenue for government
- Influence consumption
- Provide support
	- Firms
	- Low income
- Promote equity
- Correct market failure

## Government Intervention
#### Taxes
Indirect, excise taxes: Taxes imposed on producers upon production.
- Source of government revenue
- Discourage consumption of harmful goods
- Redistrubute income (Luxury Taxes)

*This chapter outlines how these taxes can distrupt an efficient allocative economy.*

Types of taxes:
- Fixed: Fixed amount per product bought/sold.
	- Leftward shift in supply curve
- Ad valorem: Percentage, increases and price increases.
	- Slope increase of supply curve.
Overall, less allocation of resources to producing the good.

**Stakeholders: Have interest in and are affected by.**
**Consumers:** Both less of it, and more expensive, lose lose situation.
**Producers:** Fall in revenue.
**Government:** Only stakeholder that gains
**Workers:** Less resources needed to produce = less workers required = less employment.
**Society:** Under-allocation, which is worse.
**Foreign producers**:

HL material: Calculation of different equations, and how they are affected from government imposed taxes.

#### Subsidies
Subsidies: Like reverse taxes, which are usually specific amounts, fixed, that are granted per unit of production. This is to:
- Increase incomes of producers, that governments support, typically agriculture.
- Allows certain goods to be more affordable to the poor, since it lowers prices.
- Overall, encourages growth in the certain market. A rightword shift in supply line.

Stakeholders:
**Consumers:** Fall in price of goods, increase in quantity purchased.
**Producers:** Receives higher price to produce larger quanitity. This translates to increase in revenues.
**Government:** Paying subsidy is burden to budget. Thus, impact on government budget is negative.
**Workers:** More likely to hire, positive.
**Society:** Better, overallocation of resources to the production of good.
**Foreign producers:** Since it provides better exports, it may interfere with competing international domestic producers.

HL Content: Calculations again.

#### Price controls
Setting min (ceiling) and max prices, so prices cannot adjust to equilibrium level. Persisting market disequililbrium.
##### Ceilings:
**Consequences**:
- Shortages in demand and supply
- Non-price rationing: Waiting in line, favouritism, coupons. (Unsatisfied means good not delivered or not bought)
- Underground markets (Illegal): Buying good at max legal price, selling it for even more.
- Under-allocation of resources: Society worse off.
- Negative welfare impacts:
**Stakeholders:**
**Consumers:** Win and lose. Those who can buy it for the cheap price win, those who are unsatisfied lose.
Producers: Lose, 

##### Floors:
**Purpose:** In agriculture, these price floors are called "price supports", ensuring that agricultural economies are still successful. 
**Consequences:** Welfare loss, inefficient farming
**Stakeholders:**
**Consumers:** Lose, paying higher price
**Producers:** Win, protected against low cost farming, as well as receiving higher prices
**Workers:** Employment boost
**Government:** Buying the excess supply is burden on budget
