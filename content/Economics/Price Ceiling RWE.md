## Analysis

In 2014, Venezuela implemented a price ceiling on many essential goods, including food, medicine, and household items. The government set a maximum price that retailers could charge for these goods, in an attempt to control inflation and make them more affordable for low-income households. 
## Evaluation
#### Short Run
- Cheaper for lower income families
- Sudden surge in demand caused consumers to rush and stock up on goods before they disappeared.
- Non-price rationing
#### Long Run
- The policy created shortages, leaving many without their basic needs.
- Led to corruption, undermining the government.
- Hyperinflation
#### Assumptions
- Consumers would comply, but they didn't, leading to black markets.
