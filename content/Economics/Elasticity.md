## Price elasticity of demand (PED):
change in quantity per change in price, in percentage, always positive:
percentage good for: comparing across different countries/units, shows more context.

levels of elacsticity: <1: relatively unresponsive
: >1: relatively responsive
=1: unit elastic
=0: perfectly inelastic
= infinity: perfectly elastic, will buy anything.

Elasticity is naturally higher at points above price=quantity. this is due to the nature of how PED is calculated, and how a shift in smaller quantities affects the overall percentage at a larger scale.
#### Determinants of PED:
- Substitutes: Number and closeness of substitutes, more elastic.
- Necessities vs luxuries: necessities are more inelastic, since you cant just not need needs.
- Length of time spent thinking about the purchase
- Portion of income spent on the good.
#### Total revenue: Price x Quantity
Effects of PED on total revenue:
- If demand is elastic, increase in price causes fall in total revenue, while decrease in price causes increase in total revenue.
- If demand is inelastic, increase in price causes increase in revenue, while decrease in price causes decrease in total revenue.
Revenue is at a maximum when PED is unit elastic.
Primary commodities: goods arising from the use of natural resources. They have lower PEDS.

In some cases, a poor supplying producer can generate higher profits, while good supplying producers decreases total revenue.

Government taxes: Government imposes indirect taxes to goods that are more inelastic. this is because the tax will decrease supply, but will not affect price/total revenue as much.
### Cross Price elasticity of Demand
(Percent change in demand for good x) / (percent change in price for good y) = xed.
if xed > 0, y and x are substitutes. Larger the absolute value of the xed, the stronger the substitution.
if xed < 0, y and x are compliments, like tennis balls and tennis rackets. larger the absolute value, more they are compliments.
of xed = 0, x and y are unrelated.
**Substitutes produces by the same company**: Sometimes, same company produces a line of products. Changing the price of one may negatively affect the other, so it is important to examine the PED of the products, and how much each is affected.
**Substitutes produced by rivals**: Knowing the xed between rivals, businesses can understand the impacts and advantages they may gain from dropping or increasing their prices. How much people will flock away?
**Mergers between firms**: Merging is beneficial between firms when XED is really high and positive. It reduces competition between the two firms
### Income elasticity of demand
YED: percentage change in quantity demanded / percentage change in income 
Yed>0: normal good
yed<0: inferior good.
Most goods are normal.
If yed > 0 && < 1, it is income inelastic, more of a luxury.
if > 1, more of a luxury.
**Applications:**
- Industry growth: In an economy that is growing, income elastic goods and industries grow, since an x% increase in average national income yields a >x% growth in the demand.
- Contrastingly applies to economic recessions. Inferior goods, which have YED < 0, will even experience increase in sales during recession.
### Price Elasticity of Supply
Formulas and definitions similar to PED. 
Only possible to compare between two curves, (supply OR demand), when there is intersection of points between the two.
#### Determinants of PES
- Length of time to respond to change in prices: Bigger the length of time, more elastic the supply.
- Mobility of factors of production: movement if factories to envionrnments where prices are increasing, causes higher pes.
- Ability to store stocks: More stocks that are abled to store, higher PES.

**Primary commodities vs manufactured products (PES comparison)**:
Primary commodities have lower pes because it takes a long time for them to respond. New irrigation systems, planting practices, things like that.
*Consequences:*
Depending on slope of demand, the supply fluctuation can change the equilibrium price by lots.
