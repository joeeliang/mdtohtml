## Analysis
In 2019, state of New York increased minimum wage from 11.10 to 12.50 per hour, aiming to increase disposable income for low-income workers.
## Evaluation
#### Short Run
- Job losses, particularly among small businesses or those with thin profit margins.
- Increased disposable income can boost consumer spending.
#### Long Run
- Some businesses can adapt, while others may go bankrupt (small resturants).
- Encourage automation, which is cheaper than hiring. (Kiosks in Mcdonalds.)
#### Assumptions
- Businesses can all absorb increased labor costs without significantly reducing employment or increasing prices. This may not hold true for all businesses, especially those with thin profit margins.
