The old consensus was that firms operated to maximize profits. Operating ethically often cut into profits, and economists saw it as disadvantageous. 

Recently, it has been shown that displeasuring consumers by engaging in unethical actions can cut profits. To avoid this, firms engage in socially desirable methods of production, effectively producing a corporate social responsibility.

Marketshare can be another objective for firms. As long as they continue to make money, the profit is a second factor.

**Satisficing**: The firm recognizes its many objectives and compromises with solutions that suffice many objectives rather than maximizing a singular one.
