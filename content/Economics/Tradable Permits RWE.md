## Analysis
In 2005, European Union Emission Trading System was implemented. It is a cap and trade system that lead to 40% decrease in emissions since implementation.
## Evaluation
## Assumption
* Companies will respond according to financial incentives 
* Governing bodies can correctly monitor (it takes significant resources to monitor actually)
## Pros
* Targets specific levels of carbon dioxide emitted, providing a clear goal for companies to work towards.
* Provides an incentive for innovation, encouraging companies to move away from carbon-emitting production methods.
## Cons
- Political pressure leads to unequal distribution of permits (manipulation)
- Relocation of companies into places that there is less regulation
- Requires resources to enforce.
- Volatile prices, such as those experienced in the Great recession, hinders long term planning.
