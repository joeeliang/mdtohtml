When moving energy levels, electrons emit packets of energies called **photons**.
They behave both like a particle and a wave. Below are equations:
$$c = \lambda f$$
$\lambda$ is wavelength and $f$ is frequency.
$$\Delta E_{electron} = \Delta E_{photon} = hf  $$
, $h$ is the planks constant.

## Some principles
[[Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]]
[[Pauli Exclusion Principle]]
## Orbitals
Areas where there is a 90% of finding the electron. They hold 2 electrons.

Principal quantum number: Number of energy levels

### Filling orbitals
Go from bottom up. Fill in single arrows with same spin across the orbital before refilling. There are [[Exceptions to Filling orbitals]].
