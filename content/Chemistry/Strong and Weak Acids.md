$$HA_{aq} + H_{2}O_{l} \rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^{+}_{aq} + A^{-}$$
The degree that the reaction lies to the right is the strength of the acid. 
**If its completely to the right, the arrow would be a single arrow.**

A strong acid has a weak base conjugate pair, because otherwise the stronger base would just react back.
# Characteristics
- More conductive
- Reacts more vigorously with metals
- Higher pH.

Remember, must be measured in same molarity, otherwise the scale is off.
