Can occur in physical or chemical systems.
## Characteristics
- Dynamic
- Closed system
- Same concentration because of same rates
- No change in macroscopic properties
- Equilibrium can be reached from either direction.
$$Reactant \leftrightharpoons Product$$
**Lies to the right is more products, or the forward reaction. To the left is more reactants, favouring the backward reaction.**
You made this mistake on a test before, so beware.

# K values

$$K = \frac{[C]^c [D]^d}{[A]^a [B]^b}$$
Its also just:$$\frac{Products}{Reactants}$$

| Value of K | Extent of Reaction                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| K << 1     | Reaction hardly proceeds                |
| K < 1      | Reaction shifted towards reactants      |
| K = 1      | Significant concentration of both sides |
| K > 1      | Reaction shifted towards products       |
| K >> 1     | Almost to Completion                    |
*K value doesn't say anything about rates*
