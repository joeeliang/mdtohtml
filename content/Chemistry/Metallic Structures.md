When metallic atoms bond, their valence electrons become delocalized. The many electrons form a "sea" of electrons. The attraction between the metal cations and electrons make the **metallic bond**.
## Properties
- Electrical conductivity
	- Mobile delocalized electrons.
- Thermal conductivity
	- Closely packed ions allow efficient transfer of heat.
- Malleable, ductile
	- Non-directional bonding, allows to be manipulated
- High melting point
	- Large sums of energy to overcome strong electrostatic forces
- Lustrous
	- Delocalized electrons reflect light
## Factors of Strength
- Number of delocalized electrons
	- Talk about electron cloud density.
- Charge of cation
	- Higher the stronger
- Radius of cation
	- Lower the stronger
