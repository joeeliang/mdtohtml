**Definition:** Half of the distance between two neighbouring nuclei.
**Trend:** 
Increases down a group
More energy levels, leading to more shells that contribute to a larger radius

Decreases across a period.
Energy level remains the same, increased attraction in the centre due to positive charge of increasing number of protons.
