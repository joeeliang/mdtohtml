Molecules are separated as **mobile phase** moves through **stationary phase**. Water moves up due to the -OH groups in cellulose. The starting point is known as the origin. The farthest point the mobile phase reaches is the solvent front.

The Retardation factor is calculated by: $\frac{component}{solvent}$ distance travelled.

Stronger attractions to the stationary phase leads to a lower $R_{f}$ value.
