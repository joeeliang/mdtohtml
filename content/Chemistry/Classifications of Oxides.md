## Basic
Metal oxides form basic oxides. They react with water to form hydroxides.
$$Na_{2}O + H_{2}O \to 2NaOH$$
## Acidic
Non-metallic oxides are acidic. They react with water to produce acidic solutions.
$$CO_{}{2} + H_{2}O \to H_{2}CO_{3}$$
When they combine together, they do a [[Neutralization Reaction]], where there is a salt and some water.

## Amphoteric oxides
They do not affect pH when added to water. However, they act like acid when put to a base, and act like a base when put against solid. An example would be $Al_{2}O_{3}$.

$$Al_{2}O_{3} + 6HCl \rightarrow 2AlCl_{3} + 3H_{2}O$$
$$Al_{2}O_{3} + 2NaOH \rightarrow 2NaAlO_{2} + H_{2}O$$
