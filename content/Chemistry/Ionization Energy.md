**Definition:** Energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous, neutral atoms.
**Trend:** Decreases down a group because of more energy levels, increasing the distance from the valence electrons to the centre. Also, electron shielding increases.
Increases across a period because electrons are closer from the positive charge.
