Formed by sharing electrons.
The strengths:
Single < Double < Triple.
The number of bonds is called the bond order. Higher bond order, smaller bond length, more energy.
**Coordinate bonds** are bonds where both electrons originate from the same atom.
## Lewis structure
Useful formula for finding number of bonds:
$$Bonds\ wanted = \frac{want - have}{2}$$
**Octet rule:** Atoms need 8 bonds to be full.
However, there are [[Octet rule exceptions]]

## Bond polarity
Electrons orbit around the more electronegative atom. This creates a **dipole moment.** The greater the electronegativity difference, the greater the shift. The total molecular polarity is the **net dipole**. Use vector addition between all bonds to find the net dipole. The vector points to the more electronegative side.
**Pure covalent bonds** have electrons that are evenly distributed. There will be no dipoles.
