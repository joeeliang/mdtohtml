Isotopes: atoms of the same element with different number of neutrons

## The 3 spectrums:
- Continuous
	- Non-discrete spectrum of all frequencies of light.
- Emission
	- Light emitted when electron drops an energy level
- Absorption
	- Continuous spectrum with discrete black lines to indicate frequencies of waves absorbed by electron.
