Rate = $\frac{\Delta c}{\Delta t}$
**Decrease in particle size implies same mass, and so faster reaction rate.**
Higher Surface area and temperature lead to a higher rate of reaction.

Depends on activation energy.
# Ways to monitor rate
- Mass changes
- Volume changes when gas is released
- Absorption using spectrometer when there is colour change
- pH change
- Conductivity change when ionic concentration changes
