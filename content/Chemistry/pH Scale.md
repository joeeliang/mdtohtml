pH is a logarithmic expression of concentration of $[H]$

$$-\log([H^+]) = pH$$
Instrument: Most accurate is pH indicator. The $Kw$ is called ionic product of water.
$$[H^+][OH^-] = Kw =10^{-14}$$
Take log of both sides to get
$$pH + pOH = 14$$
Both are same in water, so the neutral for water would be 7.

The pH is temperature dependent because of [[Le Chatelier's Principle]] on how changes in temperature modify the $k$ values. So pH should always be listed with temperature beside it.
Also note that the units inside to calculate pH should be $mol\space dm^{-3}$
