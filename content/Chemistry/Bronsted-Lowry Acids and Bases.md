The acids and bases come in **conjugate** pairs. The acids donate $H^{+}$ and the bases accept them.
# Amphiprotic
The substance can act as both an acid and a base.
Water as a base:
$$\ce{H2O + HCl -> H3O+ + Cl-}$$
Water as an acid:
$$\ce{H2O + NH3 -> NH4+ + OH-}$$
# Amphoteric
The substance can react with both acids and bases:
$$\ce{ZnO + 2HCl -> ZnCl2 + H2O}$$
Or:
$$\ce{ZnO + 2NaOH + H2O -> Na2(Zn(OH)4)}$$
But remember, Zinc is not donating any protons, so it is not amphiprotic.
# Alkalis
Alkalis form $OH^-$ when put into water.
