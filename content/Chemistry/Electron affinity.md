**Definition:** The energy required to turn one mole of neutral, gaseous atoms into anions.
**Trend:**  Decreases down a group because of more energy levels, increasing the distance from the valence electrons to the centre. Also, electron shielding increases.
Increases across a period because electrons are closer from the positive charge.
