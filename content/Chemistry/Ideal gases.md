$$PV = nRT$$
The units are in standard SI.
- Pressure in Pascals
- Volume in metres cubed
- n is moles
- R is $\frac{J}{mol\space K}$
- T is kelvin.
## Deviations in the model
*In real gasses:*
**High pressures**: Molecules are forced closer together, and empty space between particles are diminished. The assumption that volume of the particles becomes less valid.
**Low temperatures:** At low temperatures, the intermolecular forces between particles becomes more prominent.

Volume: 22.7 $mol\ dm^{-3}$
