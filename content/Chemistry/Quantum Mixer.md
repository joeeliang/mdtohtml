Was kinda like a party, learned a few things.

Firstly, participate in [[Hackathons]]

Things to learn in the summer:
[[Linear Algebra]]
[[Graph Theory]]

Both useful. Minimal linear algebra is useful for machine learning. I learned that from a PhD guy from columbia

QAI has free funding for your research projects
IBM perhaps.

Just be brave enough to email people

Learned lots from a professor from SFU
[[Double Slit Experiment]]
[[Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]]
