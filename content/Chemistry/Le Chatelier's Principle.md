Le Chatelier's principle works becauseÂ **a system will always move to relieve stress and move to a more disordered system**.

- Increase in concentration favours reaction and pushes the equilibrium further to the other side.
- Increase in pressure can be cancelled by pushing equilibrium towards the side with less molecules.

Increase in temperature shift the equilibrium away from the energy term. The K-value changes.
