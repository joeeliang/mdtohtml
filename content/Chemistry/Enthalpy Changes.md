[[Enthalpy]] is the chemical potential energy in a system.
**Endothermic** reactions are when energy goes into the system, increasing the enthalpy.
**Exothermic** reactions are when energy leaves the system, decreasing the enthalpy.
$$\Delta H^{\theta} = \sum bonds\ broken + \sum bonds\ formed$$

Reaction occurs to reduce enthalpy.

**Standard enthalpy change** ($\Delta H^{\theta}$) is the measure of energy change of the system, that occurs in a chemical equation, per mol. Standard conditions, so 100 kPa and 25 $C\degree$
## Bond enthalpy
The energy required to break one mole of bonds in a gaseous molecule under standard conditions.

**Average** bond enthalpy takes the average value of the bond enthalpy of the same bonds in different environments. For example, the two H-O bonds in $H_{2}O$ require different amounts of energy to break. The average is the average bond enthalpy of H-O.
