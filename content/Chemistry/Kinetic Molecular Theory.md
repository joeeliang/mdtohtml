1. Gas particles are in constant, random motion
2. Collisions are elastic
3. Negligible forces between gas particles
4. Negligible volume of particles
5. Temperature is average kinetic energy of all particles in substance.

To boil, gas particles escape liquid. Increasing pressure increases boiling point. Thats how pressure cookers work!
Vapour pressure > External pressure = Boiling
