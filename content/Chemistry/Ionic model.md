## About
The bond between cations and anions. Occurs when there is large $\Delta$ electronegativity.
Must remember [[Polyatomic Ions]]

## Ionic lattices
[[Enthalpy]]: Total chemical potential energy in a system
**Lattice enthalpy** ($\Delta H^{\theta}_{lattice}$): Enthalpy change when 1 mole of an ionic compound is broken up into scattered gaseous ions.
Lower the ionic radius, greater the lattice enthalpy.
## Properties
**Volatility:** Tendency to vaporize. Must overcome electrostatic forces.
**Electrical conductivity:** Ability to conduct electrical current. Must have mobile electrons.
**Solubility:** Ability to be dissolved. Solvent must be polar.
**Brittle**: Applied forces peels the layer using repulsive forces between different charged ions. [[Alloys]] prevent this.
