For [[Chemistry SL]]:
Cannot know location and momentum of an electron at the same time.

[[Veritasium]]
Uncertainty in Momentum + Uncertainty in Position > planks constant /4pi.
Macro objects don't observe this pattern because they are much larger than planks constant anyways. But smaller slits do.

[[Quantum Mixer]]
Conjugate pairs, uncertainty of one causes certainty in the other.
