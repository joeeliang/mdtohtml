## Winston's career
Winston's career is to rewrite history. He is helping the party to practice reality control in another form -- rewriting history to suit present purposes. Interestingly, the alteration of history conflicts with Winston's ideals. Winston advocates for leaving reality alone, preserving what has happened. 
Theme: The party's [[Reality control]]

The government coined the term "rectify" for the act of rewriting history. The subtle use of [[Language]], with such a euphemistic term, nullifies the barbaric act of rewriting history incorrectly. There is no "correcting". Documents that came to Winston were false in the first place, and what comes out is just as much nonsense. For the sake of preservation of truth, there is no rectification. 

*Yet another display of [[Irony]] in naming rectify*

Winston finds joy in his job. I wonder why.

## Satisfying the Proles
There are sectors in the Ministry of truth with the sole purpose of providing rubbish newsletters and meaningless films -- Astrology, Sport, pornography. The purpose is to intoxicate the lower class with entertainment, blinding them of the harsh realities of INGSOC.  Does this not **draw parallels to today's world**? The meaningless entertainment is ubiquitous, just in another form. Digital waterfalls of entertainment hidden in social media, movies. It cannot be denied such devices distract us from the pursuit of destiny and truth.

Rest of the chapter is him making up a character.
