Winston strolls into the streets of the Paroles. Firstly, notice their diction and [[language]]. It is unrestricted, without rules. Their freedom of thought reinforces the idea that "if there was a revolution, it laid in the paroles". But as quickly as the hope spawned, it was smothered. Winston witnesses another instance of [[Struggle Between Classes]], as the party sends out lotteries, with that being "the only reason why the paroles lived."

He kicks aside a hand that has been bombed, showing no empathy. The act shows the party is effective in their methods.

Within the conversation, he tries to gain insight into truth. Specifically, about whether or not life before the revolution was any better. However, it was useless. The old man seemed to have seen no difference in terms of freedom, and living standards seemed all just the same to him.

Throughout this chapter, Winston seemed to be obsessed with the past. In the street market, he could not help himself from purchasing the glass paperweight embedding a coral from the Indian ocean. This symbolizes the fragility of memory, how easily destructible it is in Winston's world.

Foreshadowing goes crazy: "The frame’s fixed to the wall," said the old man, “but I could unscrew it for you, I dare say.”

The nursery rhyme is another symbol of the past. Winston's desire to continue to purchase, to recover the shrapnels of the past is his act of rebellion. Moreover, the involvement of Saints in the nursery rhyme only adds to the rebellious idea of the rhyme. With religion outlawed in Winston's world, the continuation of such rhymes threatens the power of the upper class.
