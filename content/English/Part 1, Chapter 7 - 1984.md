Winston states that *"If there is hope, wrote Winston, it lies in the proles."*
This is because they are unindocternated, simply because the Party looks them to be the same as animals -- unintelligent, and unable to have thought.

Of course, there will always be outliers, but they are quickly eliminated. As a result, paroles are unable to revolt. Winston's two ideas combine together to form a paradox: 
"Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious." - [[1984 Quotes]]
**Theme:** [[Struggle Between Classes]]

The Party exploits this paradox, never awakening the revolution by keeping them unconscious of their suffering. This is done with intoxicating the Proles with alcohol, sport, and other nonsense that would never spark revolution. 
**Theme:** [[Media Control]]

Winston again goes on about how the only evidence that they are suffering is the instinctive protest inside your bones. [[1984 Quotes]]

"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows". Well. Looks like the Party does not want everything else to follow. Through a multitude of mechanisms: controlling media, censorship, propaganda, the reality is shaped into the desire of the Party. There is no freedom to say that two plus two make four.
