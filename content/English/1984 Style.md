# Allegory
An allegory to critique totalitarianism. The Party as totalitarian governments, Big brother as [[Surveillance]] state. Thought police as ideological enforcers.
## Analysis
The context that Orwell wrote 1984, where Nazi's were out of the picture, but communists began to push their ideologies onto neighbouring sovereign states. George Orwell wrote the novel as a satirical attack against the dismal totalitarian regimes, to warn audiences of what a totalitarian state rule would be like. Decades later, the methods the dystopian states rule with are more prominent than ever. Orwell, having combatted in war first hand in the Spanish civil war, understood the relevance of the consequences of totalitarian states seizing full power.
*I think i can incorporate the element of 1984 context into any form of analysis that comes close to political ideologies. The main purpose of the novel is to warn against totalitarian states who seize full control.*
# Allusion
Allusions in **setting** are relevant.
## Analysis
Colourless setting, bleak drowning in despair. Two minutes hate, a reference to Nazi's hate speech, all creates a sense of unease, reminiscent to that of post-war London.
# Antagonist
A constant force that cannot be stopped. The conflict against antagonists had an ending the moment it started. Uplifts the themes of class struggles and divisions by highlighting the disparities between higher and lower classes. Also, there is contrast in those who are mindful and those who are not.
# Dystopian setting
Relates to [[#Allusion]]. The important piece here is time. Although there is a specific date -- 1984, it is clear it that it is arbitrary. Winston himself made up the date as well. The vagueness of the date changes the dystopian world from a certain prediction of a certain future, to a constant threat that is always looming overhead. The vague time in setting creates a vivid warning that the threat of totalitarian state always present.
# Euphemisms
"Vaporized" instead of murdered. Or "abolished" instead of "killed". The name "rectify". "Duty to the party" instead of "sex". The euphemisms in the expression of atrocious acts are downplayed to conceal the truth. Euphemisms tie into diction.
## Analysis
Relates to the theme of [[Language]] as a means to reduce individuality. 
# Foreshadowing
The ending was written in the beginning. Find points of foreshadowing in the passage, if any.
## Analysis
However, the optimistic structure of the plot made the readers believe of a overthrowing of the entirety of the book. The foreshadowing builds to a sudden catharsis and climax of the novel -- Winston being busted. The foreshadowing makes the reader realize the end was always written from the beginning. In a world of surveillance and totalitarian regime, there is no chance for rebellion. 
# Imagery
Repetitive imagery paints the bleakness
## Analysis
Moreover, the repetitive imagery immerses the audience into the world -- where personalities and emotions are unknown, and the only observation you can make are by eye. In a way, sole use of imagery makes the audience feel trapped, unknowing of other senses, just like the characters in 1984.
# Irony
There is irony in the names, of what the characters end up being. It reflects the practice of double think.
## Analysis
The ubiquitous irony in the naming of everything is a form of propaganda, inverting reality and blurring the line between truths and lies. The inversions of reality in the slogan, names, intend to break down individuality and critical thought. Together, they highlight the dangers of government control over information and the erosion of individual autonomy.
# Third Person Perspective
Normally, a third person perspective grants objectivity. However, Orwell's portrayal of 1984 is anything but.
## Analysis
The narration deeply involves itself with Winston's thoughts and feelings. The narration creates a sense of intimacy and immediaicy, drawing the reader to Winston's confined world and making his struggle feel personal. Despite the closeness, the narrator still remains detached from Winston's emotional state, reflective of the Party's ability to control individual thoughts and feeligns.
# Limited perspective
The audience can only see the world through Winston's eyes
## Analysis
Through framing the world through a single perspective, Orwell creates a feeling of claustrophobia, confinement to a single viewpoint, as is Winston. It emphasizes the dangers of relying on a single viewpoint, especially in the dramatic yet unexpected turn of events later on. The unnoticed foreshadowing dramaticizes the realization even more, demonstrating to the reader the risks of only relying on one single perspective.
