Winston meets Julia for the first time. But when they are having their intimate moments, he is detached. No physical desire, and only the feeling of touch. It shows how [[Propaganda]] has interfered with sexual desires -- something of human nature.

From the first moment of their relationship, it has become an act of defiance and rebellion against the party. It is a matter of the [[Individual vs Collective]].
Julia then tells Winston about how she has had sex with a lot of people. Winston says: "The more men you've had, the more I love you/ Do you understand that?" It solidifies the idea that their relationship is an act of defiance more than one of love. Winston's hate for the Party even outshines the natural jealousy.
The Party's control to thought is so strong that even the sex was not pure. "It was a political act"
