# The Opening
**Winston writing down "down with big brother"**

In a world with total [[Surveillance]], where the totalitarian government of Oceania exercises absolute control over its citizens, there is no difference between having the thought and writing the thought. However, spilling unorthodoxed ideas onto tangible evidence, like Winston's scribbled note, is a step of commitment towards protest and rebellion. Still, Winston's acts are initially to himself, a private and intimate gesture of defiance against the all-powerful Big Brother. Nonetheless, it is a meaningful, personal act that marks the beginning of Winston's journey towards resistance and rebellion.

# Winston's Career
**Winston's career as a "rectifier" in the Ministry of Truth**

Winston's job involves **altering historical records**, ironically called "rectifying", to conform to the Party's ideology. The idea is to falsify information of the past. Sadly, Winston's career is built on distorting the truth, while he secretly longs for authenticity and honesty. His job serves as a reminder of the Party's omnipresent control and its ability to manipulate reality.

# Syme and Newspeak
“‘Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.’”

Syme, a **linguist and expert in Newspeak**, explains the true purpose of the Party's invented [[language]]: to limit human thought and expression, thereby preventing subversive ideas from taking root. Newspeak is designed to strip language of its complexity, nuance, and emotional depth, making it increasingly difficult for people to articulate dissenting thoughts. The sinister language policy is a hallmark of totalitarian regimes, highlighting the Party's relentless efforts to control every aspect of its citizens' lives.
[[Part 1, Chapter 5 - 1984]]
# Talking to Proles
**Winston's conversation with an old prole in a pub**

Winston's encounter with the old prole reveals the **blissful ignorance** of the working class, who seem to live in a state of happy oblivion, unaware of the Party's manipulations. The conversation serves as a contrast to Winston's own growing awareness and disillusionment with the Party's ideology. The scene also highlights the social stratification of Oceania, with the proles living in poverty and ignorance, while the Party elite enjoys relative luxury and power.
[[Part 1, Chapter 8 - 1984]]
# Rebelling with Julia
**Winston's encounters Julia**

Winston's first meeting with Julia, is marked by **mutual suspicion and tension**. Julia's sudden, unexpected behaviour, such as sticking her arm out to touch Winston's, hints at her rebellious nature and potential desire for human connection. This initial encounter sets the stage for their clandestine romance, which will become a symbol of individual defiance against the Party's all-encompassing control.
[[Part 2, Chapter 2 - 1984]]

# Building Identity with Julia
**Having free thought, building identity in sharing secrets**

"if they could make me stop loving you -- that would be the real betrayal" 

As Winston and Julia's forbidden love blossoms, they begin to **build a shared identity** through their secret meetings and stolen moments together. The tone of the chapter is much more wholesome and warm. Orwell narrates with a warmth tone to demonstrate the necessity of sharing secrets and vulnerabilities in building relationships. Without the knowledge and experience that vary from each individual, society will be homogenous. When Julia and Winston begin to share secrets, it is a step towards individuality. With the loss of [[Surveillance]] in Mr. Charrington's room, there is a step towards recovery, towards the natural state of the human mind.
Additionally, the quote about making Julia stop loving Winston sets the audience up to witness the greatest act of betrayal later in the book.
[[Part 2, Chapter 7 - 1984]]
# Shattering Paperweight
**The destruction of the glass paperweight**

The [[glass paperweight]], a symbol of the fragility of human connection in totalitarian states, is shattered, foreshadowing the destruction of Winston and Julia's relationship. The paperweight, which Winston had discovered in Mr. Charrington's antique shop, represents the tender, delicate nature of human relationships, which are easily crushed under the weight of the Party's oppression. When it is shattered, Winston could not help himself to think how small the shell inside really was, relating to the fragility and minuteness of the individual resistance. [[Individual vs Collective]].
[[Part 2, Chapter 10 - 1984]]
# The Book
**Winston's discovery of the subversive book**

"The book" is a **subversive text** that contains the truth about the Party's history and ideology. Winston's discovery of the book marks a significant turning point in his journey, as he begins to understand the true nature of the Party and its manipulation of reality. Moreover, the book is important since it creates real-world connection to the reader. As I read "the book", I drew many connections to events and states in the real world. What's more is that such a dystopian society seems more possible with the pillars of logic that are constructed in the book. [[The Book, Chapter III - War is Peace]], [[The Book, Chapter I - Ignorance is Strength]].

# Tortured and Betrayed
**Julia tells Winston she betrayed him in Room 101**

In what they told each other would be the ultimate act of betrayal, both Winston and Julia have been tortured with their biggest fear to the point of betraying the other. Having already said the act of betraying the other would mark the end of their rebellion, both Winston and Julia have been stripped of their individuality.
[[Part 3, Chapter 5 - 1984]]

# Ending - Loving Big Brother
**Winston's final submission to the Party**

In the novel's haunting conclusion, Winston, broken and defeated, gazes lovingly at a portrait of Big Brother, having been transformed into a loyal, brainwashed citizen of Oceania. The Party has succeeded in **erasing Winston's individuality**, leaving him a shadow of his former self. The ending serves as a chilling warning about the dangers of totalitarianism and the erosion of human freedom and autonomy.
