# Figurative Language
Metaphors, similes, hyperboles, allusions. Examine how the author's choices influence the interpretation of the work.
# Imagery
Pick out the sensory details. Touch, smell, sight, sound, taste.
# Language
Diction choices. Verb choices are especially powerful in higher level writing.
# Music and Sound
Examine how the poem sounds. Onomatopoeias, rhyming, alliteration. They contribute to a flow to the rhythm.
# Structure
Note how the stanzas are broken, and what the transition between them could mean. Enjambment is also common in poetry, and they tend to highlight the last word of the line in a unique way.
