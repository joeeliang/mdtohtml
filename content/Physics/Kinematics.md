## One dimensional
The application is simple. Find the correct formulas that satisfy the given unknowns.

$$
\begin{align}
s = \frac{u+v}{2}t \\
v = u + at \\
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^{2} \\
v^{2} = u^{2} + 2as
\end{align}
$$

**Range formula:** Not given in formula booklet. Memorize.
*Note:* $u^{2}$ is both horizontal and vertical components.
$$
R = \frac{u^{2}\sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

## Two dimensional
Essentially, take the $x$ and $y$ component of the object. Use one dimensional kinematic equations for each axis and solve for systems.

### Tricky bits
#### Graph interpretation
Remember, $p'' = v' = a$
