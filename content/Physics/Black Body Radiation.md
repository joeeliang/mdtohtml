$P = \sigma AT^{4}$
Multiplies by $A$ because each part of the surface is emitting a certain type of light.
Emissivity: $P = e\sigma AT^{4}$
Wein's displacement law gives the peak wavelength as a function of temperature:
$\lambda = \frac{0.0029}{T}$
### Inverse square law
Farther an object, the less intensity you get.
$I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^{2}}$
