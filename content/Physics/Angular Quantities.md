# Angular displacement
You can use angles to describe position around a circle. There can be angular displacement, just from $\theta_{f}-\theta_{i}$. 
Direction is usually counterclockwise = positive. Just like math quadrants.
# Angular Velocity
The angular velocity, denoted by $\omega$, is angular displacement overtime, $\frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}=\omega$.
# Angular acceleration
The change in angular velocity over time, $\frac{\omega_{f}-\omega_{i}}{\Delta t}$.

All instantaneous quantities for velocity and acceleration are obtained through taking the limit as $\Delta t$ approaches zero.

The linear velocity is $\frac{\Delta l}{\Delta t}$. Of course, $\Delta l = \theta r$ as with definitions of [[Radians]]. So the instantaneous linear velocity at any point is $\frac{\Delta \theta r}{\Delta t}$, or $r \omega$. Notice how the larger $r$ is, the higher the linear velocity. Points farther along the axis travel faster.

Connecting to [[Kinematics]], divide everything by $r$, you will get all the same formulas.
