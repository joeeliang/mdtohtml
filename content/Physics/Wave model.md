- Reflection: Hits a wall, goes back
- Refract: Changes direction
- Interference: Sum of waves
- Diffraction: Wave spreads out
## Transverse waves
A **pulse** is the energy origin that starts the wave. The wave speed is at which it travels at.
In reflection, hard boundary is reverse direction, and soft boundary is no reverse.

Wavelength: Peak to peak.
$$v=f\lambda$$
## Longitudinal waves
Transfer of energy as a particle collides with another. Instead of peaks and troughs, there are compressions and rarefactions. However, displacement position graphs can look like transverse waves.

## Two dimensional waves
Rays are normal wavefronts.
**Huygen's principle:** Every point on a wavefront is a source of spherical wavelets.

## Snell's law
$$\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}} = \frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2} = \frac{v^{1}}{v^{2}}$$

## Single slit diffraction
![[single slit.svg]]
Formula: $\theta=\frac{\lambda}{b}$
## Double slit interference
Similar amplitude and waves in phase. On the wall, there are points where the two waves are out of phase by $\pi$. Here there is destructive interference, a dark spot. They can also be exactly in phase, offset by $n\lambda$, where n is some integer. There is constructive interference here, and a bright spot.
*The pattern is like a double slit stuff inside a single slit diffraction pattern*

For many slits, $n\lambda=d\sin \theta$
