**Internal energy**: Total intermolecular potential energy from the forces between the molecules plus the total kinetic energy from the random movement of all the particles.
**Heat energy**: Energy transferred from a hot object to a cold object.
**Temperature:** Average kinetic energy of all the molecules.

Boltzmann curve: Distribution of particle speeds increases in range for higher temperatures, but the peak lowers.
Formula and diagram for the peak.

**Conduction** as a method of transferring heat:
$$\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = k A \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}$$
## Thermal capacity
$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta t}$
specific, is just per gram, so
$c = \frac{Q}{m\Delta t}$

Latent heat is the energy required to change state, $L = \frac{Q}{m}$

### Temperature
$$E_{k} = \frac{3}{2}kT$$
The formula is different for single molecules
Pressure is $\frac{F}{A}$, $P=\frac{1}{3}\rho v^{2}$

$$Q - W= \Delta U$$
