Goes in circle because there is acceleration towards the centre. The instantaneous velocity is changing, so there really is acceleration. See [[#proof]].
$$a=\frac{v^{2}}{r}$$
Substitute the circumference divided by period for $v$. [[Angular Quantities]].
$$\frac{4\pi^{2}r}{T^{2}}=\omega^{2}r$$
To get $F_{net}$, multiply by $m$. $F_{t}$ doesn't have direction?
## Proof
$a= \frac{v^2}{r}=\frac{2\pi r}{T}^2 \times \frac{1}{r}=\frac{4\pi r}{T^{2}}$
# Relation to cars

The static friction is perpendicular to the direction of travel. See [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/87976/direction-of-friction-when-a-car-turns). When skidding, there is no longer static friction perpendicular to direction of travel, instead kinetic friction that is weaker and opposite direction of travel.
# Strings and Gravity
The tension and length of string have to use trigonometry again.
# Universal Gravitation Law
$$F_{g} = G \frac{m^{1}m^{2}}{r^2}$$
# Radius and Period
Using:
$$\frac{4\pi^{2}r}{T^{2}}=F_{g}$$
Turn $F_{g}$ into the universal gravitational law, to get
$$\frac{4\pi^{2}r}{T^{2}}=G \frac{m^{1}m^{2}}{r^2}$$
