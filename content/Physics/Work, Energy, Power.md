**Work:** $W = Fs\cos(\theta)$

**Energy** is the ability to do work. Unit in $J$, Joules.
**Kinetic:** $E_{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$
**Potential:** $E_{p} = mgh$
**Spring:** $E_{E} = \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$

*Note: $\theta$ is for acting on a body at an angle.*
Mechanical energy is $E_{k} + E_{p}$.

In a conserved system, kinetic and potential energy exchange. Otherwise, they are lost.

**Power** is the rate work is done.
$P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} = Fv$.
Both are super useful.
