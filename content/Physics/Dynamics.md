## Newton's Laws of Motion
1. Object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force. *Inertia*.
2.  $F = ma$
3. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. $$F_{AB} = - F_{BA}$$
## Forces
A push or a pull, vector quantities measured in Newtons (N). The $F_{net}$ is the sum of all forces.
### Friction
**Kinetic friction**: Friction that object feels when moving, where $F_{fr} = \mu_{k}F_{N}$
For objects at rest, there is **static friction**, where $F_{fr} < \mu_{s}F_{N}$ .
Note: $\mu_{s} > \mu_{k}$
