221.        ***Galilean Transformation –** equations that translate measurements made in one frame of reference to another frame of reference without taking into account the theory of relativity

222.        ***Inertial Frame of Reference –** a frame of reference that is not accelerating but is at rest or moving with a constant velocity  (OR: a frame of reference in which Newton’s law of inertia is valid, that is, a frame in which an object with no unbalanced forces will remain at rest or move at a constant velocity)

223.        ***Special Theory of Relativity –** Consists of two postulates:

            1) The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.

            2)  The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers.

224.        ***Simultaneity –** Two events occurring at different points in space and which are simultaneous for one observer cannot be simultaneous for another observer in a different frame of reference.

225.        **Light Clock –** a beam of light reflected between two parallel mirrors used to measure time

226.        ***Proper Time Interval –** the time between events as measured in a frame where the events take place at the same point in space (NOTE: This is the shortest possible time that any observer could correctly record for the event and is usually the time measured in the moving frame of reference.)

227.        **Time Dilation –** an effect of relativity in which moving clocks run slow

228.        **Lorentz Factor (γ) –** a relativistic factor that varies from approximately 1 at low velocities to approaching infinity near the speed of light

230.        **Length Contraction –** an effect of relativity in which the separation between two points  in space contracts if there is relative motion in that direction

231.        **Twin Paradox –** different observers’ measurements of the time taken for a journey at speeds close to the speed of light will not be the same  (NOTE: Since one of the twins has to accelerate in the spaceship, this is no longer a symmetrical situation for the twins.  The space journeying twin records a shorter time measurement (“ages less.”))

232.        **Hafele-Keating Experiment –** a 1971 test of the predictions of time dilation in which atomic clocks were put in aircraft and flown, east and west, around the world and then compared with clocks that remained fixed in the same location on Earth (NOTE: The clock flying eastward, being the fastest relative to the surface of the Earth, recorded the smallest elapsed time.) (NOTE: The experiment also had to take into account the effects of general relativity since the clocks were at different heights in a gravitational field.)

235.        **Michelson-Morley Experiment –** an experiment comparing the speed of light measured in two perpendicular directions using interference patterns– originally meant to measure the speed of the Earth through the ether – did not produce any observable difference in the speeds – implies that the ether does not exist and that the result is consistent with the constancy of the speed of light – gives experimental support for one of the postulates of special relativity

239.        ***Inertial Mass –** the property of an object that determines how much it accelerates when a given force is applied to it (OR: the ratio of resultant force to acceleration of an object) (NOTE: Different inertial masses have different acceleration s when a force acts on them.)

240.        ***Principle of Equivalence –** a postulate that states there is no difference between an accelerating frame of reference and a gravitational field

241.        **Einstein’s Closed Elevator “Thought Experiment” –** an object dropped inside a closed elevator will accelerate toward the floor – could be explained in one of two ways: either the elevator is far from any planet but accelerating upward  or the elevator is at rest on the surface of planet

242.        **Spacetime –** four dimensional coordinates used to describe any event (three spatial dimensions and time) (NOTE: Moving objects follow the shortest path between two points in spacetime.) (NOTE: Gravitational attraction can be explained by the warping of spacetime.)

247.        **Gravitational Red Shift –** a prediction of the general theory relativity in which clocks slow down in a gravitational field (that is, clocks on the ground floor of a building will run slowly as compared with clocks on the top floor)

248.        **Eddington Eclipse Measurements –** Arthur Eddington’s 1919 measurements during the eclipse of the Sun of the apparent change in position of a star – experimental support for the bending of light by a massive object which is a prediction of general relativity

249.        **Pound-Rebka Experiment –** measurements in 1960 of the decrease in frequency of a photon as it climbs in a gravitational field – experimental evidence to support gravitational red-shift which is a prediction of general relativity

250.        **Atomic Clock Frequency Shift Experiment –** experiment comparing two identical atomic clocks, one on the ground and one sent to a high altitude in a rocket – higher altitude clock runs faster - experimental evidence to support gravitational red-shift which is a prediction of general relativity

251.        **Shapiro Time Delay Experiments –** experiment in which the time taken for a radar pulse to travel to a nearby planet and return is measured – the gravitational field of the Sun affects the time taken – measurements confirm the predictions made by general relativity as to the amount of effect on time – experimental evidence to support gravitational red-shift which is a prediction of general relativity
