**Momentum**, $p = mv$ .
Newton's second law can be written as:
$$\sum F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$
Momentum is conserved in all isolated, closed systems.
*Elastic collisions* are when kinetic energy is conserved.

**Impulse**, $J = \Delta p = F \Delta t$.

## One-dimensional collisions
There is an important formula that is not described in the textbook.
$$V_{A}-V_{B} = - (V_{A}^{'} - V_{B}^{'})$$
