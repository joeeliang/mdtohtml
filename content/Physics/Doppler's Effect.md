The trick: Imagine the situation in your head, then according to that, see what size the frequency should be. Using that, decide whether to add or subtract the $u$.
For electromagnetic radiation, use 
$\Delta f = \frac{v}{c}f_{0}$. Double it again since there is both moving source and moving observer.
