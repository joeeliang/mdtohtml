# Thermodynamic system
Big use of PV diagrams. The area under the increase of volume is work done. 
## First law
$$Q = \Delta U+W$$
On the PV diagrams: isovolumetric for volume and isobaric for pressure.
# Adiabatic processes
Occurs so fast there are no exchanges in heat. Crosses temperatures.
# Efficiency 
Normally, its $\frac{W}{Q_{hot}}=1 - \frac{Q_{cold}}{Q_{hot}}$
In carnot, which is the maximum efficiency, the gas does work and cools down, the max efficiency is $1-\frac{T_{cold}}{T_{hot}}$ since $T \propto Q$.
