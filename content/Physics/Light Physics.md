Light is a transverse wave that is perpendicular to the direction of travel.
Light will reflect and refract at a change in medium as other waves due to a change in velocity.

Index of refraction = $n = \frac{c}{v}$

When light hits a prism, its light ray scatters. This forms a rainbow! Blue bends best.
